          There are two types of interest for loan payments: <br>
          1. Simple Interest: Simple interest is based on the principal amount of a loan or deposit. <br>
              Formula: <br>
              Simple Interest=P*r*n <br> <br>

              P=Principal amount <br>
              r=Annual interest rate <br>
              n=Term of loan (years) <br><br>
â€‹
          2. Compound Interest: Compound interest is based on the principal amount and the interest that accumulates on it in every period. <br>
              Formula: <br>
              Compound Interest=(P*(1+r)^t) - P <br><br>

              P=Principal amount <br>
              r=Annual interest rate <br>
              t=Number of years interest is applied <br><br>
